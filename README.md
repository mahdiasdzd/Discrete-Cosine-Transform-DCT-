# Discrete-Cosine-Transform-DCT-
Well, now the DCT or Discrete Cosine Transform method In this method, we show the discrete cosine transform of an image as a sum of sinuses with different magnitudes and frequencies. The dct2 function calculates the two-dimensional discrete cosine transform (DCT) of an image, but DCT has the characteristic that for In a typical image, most of the important visual information about the image is concentrated in only a few DCT coefficients. For this reason, DCT is often used in image compression applications, so this is the cliche application. There is a general mathematical formula that you can search on the net. There is one characteristic, and I will send it to you. It has two main dimensions, which are identified by alpha and beta. There is another formula, which, of course, we did not use in the code, to reverse the situation when we use these functions. We use the amount that they give us as a weight, so it can be calculated as a half of our model, but it cannot be used in everything. We have to make a model for each image. The signal that is given from the image is always an 8x8 matrix, whose value is always constant, if this value is not constant. Because our functions have weight, the logic gets messed up and our work is wrong. The exact same formula is used in the code and the summary of the code and no special library is used.
